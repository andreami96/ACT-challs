# ACT challs

This repository contains two CTF-like challenges: __awsum_quotes__ and __littlerev__. Besides the binaries, both challenges are provided with the source code, an extensive write-up and a python3 exploit. 

If you want to try them out, ignore exploits and writeups: just download the binaries and enjoy the pwnage!
